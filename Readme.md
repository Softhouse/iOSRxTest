# Labs for ReactiveCocoa

ReactiveCocoa is an Objective-C framework for Functional Reactive Programming. (Read more about Reactive Cocoa at their [GitHub page][https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa].)

While we feel that FRP is a great way to structure your apps, there is a lack of documentation and examples for novices to use. This repository is a place for some code we've used to start understanding ReactiveCocoa, we hope it will give value to any other developers as well.

At the moment, the repo contains three examples, two of which are rather simple, and the third a bit more advanced (RTAsyncFetch).

Happy hacking!
